title: The Hardest Problem in Data Science

I have a question for you: **What's the hardest problem in all of data science right now?** 

* [Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)? 

* Ethics? 

* Gender gap?

* Reproducibility?

* Ubiquitous, opaque algorithms that drive nearly all facets of our lives (see [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815))? 
 
Given your particular set of core values and whether you're personally affected by particular issues (e.g. the gender gap), you may rank certain issues as more or less important than someone else. That's completely understandable. However, there is, at least in my opinion, a more universal problem at large, one that creeps, overtly or implicitly, into the vast majority of conversations and articles about data science. It's an issue we dance around, often without knowing it. And it's one that in some senses is the most easily solvable.  

But before I get to that, I want to make one thing crystal clear: my goal is not to minimize the importance of the aforementioned problems. On the contrary, I'm of the mind that we should strive first to be cognizant of them and then, at the very least, do our part within our small spheres of influence to affect change at the micro-level. 

Now take three well-known industries: law, medicine, and physics. I imagine few people would struggle differentiating a lawyer, a doctor, and a physicist. Go down a level. I doubt many would have difficulties delineating a paralegal and a lawyer, a nurse and a doctor, or a theoretical physicist from an experimental physicist. Ok, maybe the last one is a little tricky. But you get the point. 

Let's try something more challenging. What's the difference between a statistician, a computer scientist, and a data scientist?

No doubt, it's easy to separate the statistician from the computer scientist, but the statisitician or the computer scientist from the data scientist? Not such an easy feat! Why is that and why is it so easy to separate the other professions? 

Data science is clearly an interdisciplinary profession, one that borrows ideas from other domains. But that's certainly not unique to data science. Domains steal ideas from one another on the regular. So what's the problem?

Think about the what's universal to law, medicine, and physics. The major theme boils down to this: each industry has its own explicitly defined vernacular. Each is comprised of unambiguous and unique terms. Two lawyers can discuss *torts* or *mens rea* without issue. One doctor can use the term *sternocleidomastoid* and another will know exactly what he/she means. A group of physicists can discuss *torque* and *angular momentum* without having to describe what those terms mean. In all cases, the terms are clear, unique, and allow for efficient communication.

This is not the case in data science. We can't even agree on what a data scientist is let alone simplify the dizzying language we use. Is the proper term *column*, *feature*, *independent variable*, or *field*? Is it a *model* or an *algorithm*? A *row*, a *sample*, an *observation*, or a *record*? 

Sure we borrowed language from more mature disciplines, but if data science is to become a domain all its own, it desperately needs to standardize its language. Let's avoid the countless hours spent violently agreeing but using different terminology and instead focus our efforts on AGI and ethics and the gender gap and reproducibility and opaque algorithms - the problems that really matter!
