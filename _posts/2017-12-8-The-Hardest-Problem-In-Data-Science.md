If I asked you "What's the hardest problem in all of data science right now?", what would you say? [Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)? The ubiquitous and innumerable opaque algorithms that drive myriad facets of our lives (see [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815))? Something else?
