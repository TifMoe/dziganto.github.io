## Introduction
This post covers the basic assumptions of Linear Regression. Additionally, how to investigate whether assumptions are met, how to diagnose problems, and how to address those problems are covered. 

## Linear Regression Assumptions
1. Linear relationship between target and features
2. No outliers
3. No high-leverage points 
4. Homoscedasticity of error terms
5. Uncorrelated error terms 
6. Independent features
